## üñ•Ô∏è Pymon CRT

designed with the idea of a Task_mger_4Screenmax1ng_onMiniMonitors, Created my own task manager with python to screen max random pc stats in small screens. this was designed soley to be used alongside [Hagibis 3.5inch IPS USB Mini Screen.](https://hagibis.com/usb-c-hub-with-second-screen-p00288p1.html) ideally used at a max scale of 100% display settings with a max resolution of 960x600
when using the small screen that it was designed for.
